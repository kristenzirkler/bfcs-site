            <p>More than 900 people per month are served by the BFCS Food Box Program, which is a part of the agency's Food and Nutrition Program. For more information about the program and eligibility requirements, <a href="food-nutrition.php">click here.</a></p>

            <p>As part of the agency's Food and Nutrition Program, the agency also provides a monthly class in healthy food preparation to teach parents ways to prepare healthy meals for their children and families.</p>
