  		<h4>Mary Magalene Black</h4>
  		<h6>President and Chief Executive Officer</h6>
  		<p>Ms. Black founded BFCS to meet the needs of under-served children and families in 1984. This community-based agency has grown steadily to become a thriving social service organization. Ms. Black is widely recognized as one of Arizona's leading advocates for improving the lives of children and families in all ethnic groups who survive in under-served conditions. She has envisioned and created many programs through cultivating community resources without reliance on public support. And several of the agency’s services have grown to become important subcontractors to county and state agencies which now rely upon BFCS to provide essential community social and behavioral services.</p>
  		<p>Since 1984, Ms. Black has developed numerous programs, including: Juvenile Intervention, a pregnancy prevention program for teens; a behavioral health counseling program for children and families; a substance abuse out-patient program for adults; Foster Care and Adoption programs that have placed hundreds of children in nurturing homes; one of the first 25 Charter Schools in the state of Arizona (which was open from 1995 – 2004); provided the vision and leadership, in 1994, to renovate a 27,000 square foot facility with only private sector partnerships; and, most recently, expanded the foster care program to provide Therapeutic Foster Care to some of Arizona’s most emotionally fragile children.</p>
